//! # persistent-memory
//!
//! This crate provides mid-level Rust wrappers for working with persistent memory.
//!
//! This crate makes extensive use of instructions of modern CPUs, particularly Skylake.
//!
//! To ensure these instructions are used, build with `cargo rustc -- -C target-feature=+sse2,+rdrnd,+clflushopt,+clwb`.
//!
