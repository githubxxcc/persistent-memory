//! # persistent-memory
//!
//! This crate provides mid-level Rust wrappers for working with persistent memory.
//!
//! This crate makes extensive use of instructions of modern CPUs, particularly Skylake.
//!
//! To ensure these instructions are used, build with `cargo rustc -- -C target-feature=+sse2,+rdrnd,+clflushopt,+clwb`.
//!

/// 1. Immediately after a `store`, write back the written value by issuing a pwb().
/// 2.a. Immediately before a `store-release` issue a `pfence()`.
/// 2.b. Immediately after a `store-release` write-back the written value by issuing a `pwb()`.
/// 3. Immediately after a `load-acquire` write-back the loaded value by issuing a `pwb()` followed by a `pfence()`.
/// 4a. Handle `CAS-acquire-release` as a combination of `store-release` and `load-acquire`:-
/// 	- immediately before the CAS, issue a `pfence()`
///  - immediately after the CAS,  write-back the loaded value by issuing a `pwb()` followed by a `pfence()`.
/// 4b. As for 4a, but also for `fetch_add` and `exchange` and probably all other read-modify-write instructions.
/// 5. Do nothing for `load`.
/// 6. Before taking any I/O action, issue a `psync()` to ensure all changes have reached persistent storage.
/// 7. Pedro Ramalhete & Andreia Correia argue that (4) does not require a `pfence()` before and a `pfence()` after on x86_64 because read-modify-write instructions (CAS, fetch_add, exchange, etc) ensure order for `clflushopt` and `clwb`.
