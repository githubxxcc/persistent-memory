/// Issues a `sfence`.
/// Orders processor execution relative to all memory stores prior to the `sfence` instruction.
/// The processor ensures that every store prior to SFENCE is globally visible before any store after `sfence` becomes globally visible.
/// The `sfence` instruction is ordered with respect to memory stores, other `sfence` instructions, `mfence` instructions, and any serializing instructions (such as the `cpuid` instruction).
/// It is not ordered with respect to memory loads or the `lfence` instruction.
///
/// Weakly ordered memory types can be used to achieve higher processor performance through such techniques as out-of-order issue, write-combining, and write-collapsing.
/// The degree to which a consumer of data recognizes or knows that the data is weakly ordered varies among applications and may be unknown to the producer of this data.
/// The `sfence` instruction provides a performance-efficient way of ensuring store ordering between routines that produce weakly-ordered results and routines that consume this data.
///
/// To ensure this intrinsic is available, use `cargo rustc -- -C target-feature=+sse2`.
///
/// It is believed that `sfence` does not cause a TSX abort.
