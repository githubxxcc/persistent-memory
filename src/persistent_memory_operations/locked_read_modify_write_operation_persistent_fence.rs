/// Pedro Ramalhete & Andreia Correia argue that the preceding and following `persistent_fence()` for locked read-modify-write operations (eg compare-and-swap, swap, fetch-add, etc) are not needed on x86_64 when using `clflushopt()` or `clwb()` because locked read-modify-write instructions ensure order for `clflushopt()` and `clwb()`.
/// This implies that are needed when using the older `clflush()` and on AArch64.
