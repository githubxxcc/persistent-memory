/// This is an implementation of the function `psync` in the paper [Brief Announcement: Preserving Happens-before in Persistent Memory](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jhi1/papers/2016-spaa-transform) which provides a generic scheme for working with persistent memory and atomic operations.
///
/// Use this before taking any I/O action, issue a `persistent_sync()` to ensure all changes have reached persistent storage.
/// In practice this means using it before returning from any function call that has an observable side-effect, eg a constructor, `drop`, an enqueue or dequeue to a persistent queue, etc.
///
/// Acts as a memory fence.
///
/// Blocking.
///
/// Finishes when all preceding `persistent_fence()` in this thread have completed.
